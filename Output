## 🔹 Output / Results

- The system successfully detected persons in the input drone video using **YOLOv4-Tiny**.  
- For persons wearing **red jackets**, the torso region exceeded the red pixel threshold → labeled as **“ALERT: Red Jacket”**.  
- Other persons were labeled as **“Person”**.  
- Bounding boxes were drawn in **red** for alerts and **green** for normal detections.  
- The final processed video was saved as **`output_red_jacket.mp4`**.  

✅ **Observations:**  
- Robust detection even with varying lighting conditions.  
- False positives reduced by combining **YOLOv4-Tiny person detection** + **HSV color filtering**.  
- Real-time capable on CPU for standard video input.
