1. Aim and Understanding of the Problem  
The aim of this project is to design a color-based object tracking system using OpenCV to support search and rescue operations in disaster zones. The system processes drone-captured videos and identifies color-coded markers or jackets worn by victims or rescue personnel. By tracking these objects in real-time, drones can assist ground teams by quickly locating survivors or designated rescue markers. 
 
2. Dataset Preparation  
Dataset Source: Drone-captured video (test video with a person wearing a red jacket).
Object of Interest: Person wearing a red jacket (focus on torso region).
Video specifications:
•	FPS: Extracted automatically using OpenCV
•	Resolution: Extracted from input video properties
Pre-processing Steps:
•	Video read frame-by-frame using OpenCV’s cv2.VideoCapture.
•	Each frame passed through YOLOv4-Tiny for person detection.
•	Region of interest (upper 50% of detected person) extracted to focus on torso.
•	ROI converted to HSV color space for robust red color detection.
•	Two HSV ranges for red were defined to capture both dark red and bright red tones.
•	Binary masks combined to isolate red-colored regions.
•	Morphological operations (opening and dilation) applied to remove noise.
This preparation ensures that only red jackets worn by detected persons are highlighted accurately.
 
3. Selection of Suitable OpenCV Techniques / Algorithms  

The following techniques were chosen:
1.	YOLOv4-Tiny for Person Detection
o	Used cv2.dnn.readNet() with pre-trained YOLOv4-Tiny weights and config.
o	Forward pass performed to detect only class person (class_id = 0).
o	Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) applied to refine bounding boxes.
2.	Region of Interest Extraction
o	From each detected person, the top 50% (torso) cropped for jacket detection.
3.	Color Space Conversion
o	cv2.cvtColor(ROI, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV) used to convert to HSV.
o	Advantage: HSV separates color from brightness, improving robustness to lighting changes.
4.	Color Masking (Thresholding)
o	cv2.inRange() applied with two red ranges:
	Range 1: [0,150,150] → [10,255,255]
	Range 2: [170,150,150] → [180,255,255]
o	Both masks combined to detect full spectrum of red tones.
5.	Morphological Filtering
o	cv2.morphologyEx(mask, MORPH_OPEN + MORPH_DILATE) used to reduce noise.
o	Kernel size: 5×5.
6.	Decision Rule
o	If more than 5% of torso pixels are red, classify as “ALERT: Red Jacket”.
o	Otherwise, label as “Person”.
7.	Visualization & Output
o	Bounding boxes and labels drawn with cv2.rectangle() and cv2.putText().
o	Final video saved using cv2.VideoWriter().
 
4. Implementation of Code in Python/OpenCV  
    Implementation Overview:
•	Python 3 with OpenCV and NumPy libraries used.
•	YOLOv4-Tiny model loaded using config and weight files.
•	Video processed frame by frame.
•	YOLO used to detect persons, after which only the torso region was analyzed.
•	HSV color filtering applied to detect red jackets.
•	Binary masks processed with morphological operations.
•	Bounding boxes labeled either “Person” (green) or “ALERT: Red Jacket” (red).
•	Output video saved as output_red_jacket.mp4. 
 
Code Snippet: 
blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 1/255.0, (320, 320), swapRB=True, crop=False)
net.setInput(blob)
outputs = net.forward(output_layers)

for detection in outputs[0]:
    scores = detection[5:]
    class_id = np.argmax(scores)
    confidence = scores[class_id]
    if class_id == 0 and confidence > 0.6:
        hsv = cv2.cvtColor(upper_body, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
        mask1 = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower_red1, upper_red1)
        mask2 = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower_red2, upper_red2)
        mask = mask1 | mask2  

        red_pixels = cv2.countNonZero(mask)
        total_pixels = upper_body.shape[0] * upper_body.shape[1]

        if total_pixels > 0 and (red_pixels / total_pixels > 0.05):
            label = "ALERT: Red Jacket"
        else:
            label = "Person" 

5. Experimental Results and Visual Output 
Results Observed:
•	System successfully detected persons in drone video using YOLOv4-Tiny.
•	For persons wearing red jackets, torso region exceeded red pixel threshold → labeled as “ALERT: Red Jacket”.
•	Other persons labeled as “Person”.
•	Bounding boxes drawn in green (normal) or red (alert).
•	Video output saved as output_red_jacket.mp4.
Visual Output:
•	Detected persons correctly highlighted in real-time frames.
•	Alerts visible clearly due to bounding box colors and text labels.
 
 

Observations:
•	Robust performance even under moderate lighting variations.
•	False positives minimized due to YOLO + color threshold combination.
•	Scalable to real-time drone feeds.
 
6.Interpretation and Discussion of Results  

Strengths:
•	Uses pre-trained YOLOv4-Tiny model → lightweight and fast.
•	Accurate person localization before color filtering.
•	Real-time capable with CPU execution.
Limitations:
•	Detection accuracy may drop in poor lighting or if jacket shade is very dark.
•	Assumes red jacket occupies significant portion of torso.
Future Improvements:
•	Integrate advanced deep learning classifiers for clothing color detection.
•	Implement multi-object tracking (SORT/Kalman Filter) to follow multiple people.
•	Deploy on embedded GPU systems (e.g., Jetson Nano) for real-world drone applications.
 7. Project Report Quality and Documentation

•	The code is clearly commented, explaining each step of the YOLOv4-Tiny detection and HSV-based red jacket analysis.
•	Screenshots of sample frames provide visual proof of detection.
•	Output video demonstrates successful application of the system.
•	Documentation includes: aim, methodology, code, results, and discussion.
•	Recommendations for further work:
•	Extend AI/ML models for more robust clothing color classification (beyond HSV thresholds).
•	Process real-time drone feed for live alerts.
•	Reduce false positives using shape analysis, motion tracking, or temporal consistency checks.
8. Conclusion 
The project successfully demonstrates a color-based object tracking system using OpenCV to detect red jackets in drone-captured videos. The detected objects are clearly highlighted with bold green rectangles and semi-transparent overlays, accompanied by visible alert messages, making them easily identifiable for search and rescue operations. The system is robust against variations in lighting and object size, and resizing frames allows efficient processing even in high-resolution videos. This approach provides a practical and effective tool for disaster response, reducing manual monitoring and improving operational efficiency. With minor enhancements, such as integrating machine learning for multi-object detection, the system can be extended for real-time, large-scale search and rescue applications.
